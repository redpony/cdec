europe 's divided racial house
a common feature of europe 's extreme right is its racism and use of the immigration issue as a political wedge .
the lega nord in italy , the vlaams blok in the netherlands , the supporters of le pen 's national front in france , are all examples of parties or movements formed on the common theme of aversion to immigrants and promotion of simplistic policies to control them .
while individuals like jorg haidar and jean @-@ marie le pen may come and ( never to soon ) go , the race question will not disappear from european politics anytime soon .
an aging population at home and ever more open borders imply increasing racial fragmentation in european countries .
