To build cdec, you'll need:

 * boost headers & boost program_options (you may need to install a package
    like libboost-dev)


Instructions for building
-----------------------------------

 1) Create a build directory and generate Makefiles using CMake

        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
 
    If the cmake command completes successfully, you can proceed. If you have
    libraries (such as Boost) installed in nonstandard locations, you may need
    to run cmake with special options like -DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost.

 2) Build

        make -j 2
   
 3) Test
        make test
        ./tests/run-system-tests.pl

    Everything should pass.


 4) Enjoy!
