`cdec` is a research platform for machine translation and similar structured prediction problems.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/redpony/cdec.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/redpony/cdec)

## System requirements 

- A Linux or Mac OS X system
- A C++ compiler implementing at least the [C++-11 standard](http://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html)
    - Some systems may have compilers that predate C++-11 support.
    - You may need to build your own C++ compiler or upgrade your operating system's.
- [Boost C++ libraries (version 1.44 or later)](http://www.boost.org/)
    - If you build your own boost, you _must install it_ using `bjam install` (to install it into a customized location use `--prefix=/path/to/target`).
    - Older versions of Boost _may_ work, but problems have been reported with command line option parsing on some platforms with older versions.
- [GNU Flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net/)
- [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/) - <font color="red"><b>(NEW)</b></font>

## Building the software from a git clone

In addition to the standard `cdec` third party software requirements, you will additionally need the following software to work with the `cdec` source code directly from git:

Build instructions:

    cmake .
    make -j4
    make test
    ./tests/run-system-tests.pl
